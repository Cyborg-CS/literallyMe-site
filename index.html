          <p><strong>Wow, This Is Literally Me</strong> refers to a series of images in which a certain individual
            relates
            to characters from films, TV shows and other media, usually outsider figures with certain redeemable
            qualities. The images are used to poke fun at these individuals due to their supposed lack of the positive
            qualities that the film characters possess.</p>
